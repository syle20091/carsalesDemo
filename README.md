# carsalesDemo

Approach:

1 Using MVVM design pattern
2 Using Alamofire to fetch image
3 Centralized service call to CarService file
4 Using various extensions to make code simple and more reusable
5 Using viewModel to prevent viewController and view to touch model directly - thus more easier for unit testing
6 Using extension to make code more readable
